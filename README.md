#### _{This programm let user to calculate the current age on different planets. User just need to add their current age or age that they want to use. There are set from four different planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter.}_

## Technologies Used

 * _Html
 * _JQuery
 * _JavaScript
 * _Jest
 * _Bootstrap
 * _jquery
 * _popper.js

## Description

_{The business logic of your application should take a person's age in years and create a class that does the following:}_

 * _Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)_
 * _Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)_
 * _Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)_
 * _Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)_
 * _Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planetâ€¦ (yikes!)_
 * _To do this, the application will have to calculate the user's life expectancy. You can determine average life expectancy as you see fit._
_{A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average life expectancy for their demographic. A more involved way to do this would be to collect other information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to determine their life expectancy.}_
7. * _If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy. The number of years lived past life expectancy should be a positive number._
